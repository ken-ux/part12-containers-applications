# [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This is my implementation of exercises 12.1 - 12.20 of the Containers course hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. In it, I set up development and production environments for a simple to-do app using Docker.

## Lessons Learned

- Building Docker images.
- Running and inspecting Docker containers.
- Creating volumes for persistent data.
- Communicating between containers in a Docker network.
- Serving static files with nginx.

## Course Summary

In this part, we will learn how to package code into standard units of software called containers. These containers can help us develop software faster and easier than before. Along the way, we will also explore a completely new viewpoint for web development, outside of the now-familiar Node.js backend and React frontend.

We will utilize containers to create immutable execution environments for our Node.js and React projects. Containers also make it easy to include multiple services with our projects. With their flexibility, we will explore and experiment with many different and popular tools by utilizing containers.
